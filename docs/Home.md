**Project Description**
Implementation of Smalltalk on the DLR. 

The immediate goal of the project is to create a Smalltalk dialect that:
# Is X3J20 (ANSI INCITS 319-1998) Compliant Smalltalk
# Is First Class Member of the DLR Family
# Has an easy / transparent interop with .Net
# Has Decent Performance

Future goals include:
# A GUI interface layer; at some point hopefully having a system that could target either XAML or XNA.
# Better integration with .Net languages, class libraries and tools.

There are 3 things you can do if you would like to help out with this project:
# Become familiar with X3J20 (http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI+INCITS+319-1998+(R2007))
# Study how the DLR works.  There are some useful links in the Documentation directory of the source download.
# Start playing!
